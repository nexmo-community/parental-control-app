# parental-control-app

Sample code for building a voice parental control application

This repository has two parts - a server (voice webhook) and an Android application, you will need to setup both projects:

1. [Server](./parental-control-server/README.md)
2. [Application](./parental-control-app/README.md)

After setting both components, and after the required setup in the Vonage dashboard, you will be able to-

1. Redirect calls from Android through Vonage, and by that masking your phone
2. Enjoy the verity of features Vonage's Voice API offers on your calls
